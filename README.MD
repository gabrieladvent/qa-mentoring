# ðŸ§ª Automation Testing Setup with Playwright

This documentation provides a guide to set up and run automated tests using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager in this setup. You may also use `npm` or `yarn`â€”refer to the Playwright documentation if you prefer a different tool.

### Step-by-Step Installation

Run the following command to initialize a new Playwright project:

```bash
pnpm create playwright
```

You will be prompted with several setup questions. Below are the options selected during the setup:

```
Initializing project in '.'
âœ” Do you want to use TypeScript or JavaScript? â†’ JavaScript
âœ” Where to put your end-to-end tests? â†’ tests
âœ” Add a GitHub Actions workflow? â†’ No
âœ” Install Playwright browsers? â†’ Yes
âœ” Install Playwright OS dependencies? â†’ No

```

After the setup, your project structure should look like this:

```
my-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ example.spec.js
â”œâ”€â”€ playwright.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## ðŸš€ Running Tests

Here are some common commands to run your tests:

- Runs the end-to-end tests.

```bash
  pnpm exec playwright test
```

- Starts the interactive UI mode.

```bash
  pnpm exec playwright test --ui
```

- Runs the tests only on Desktop Chrome.

```bash
  pnpm exec playwright test --project=chromium
```

- Runs the tests in a specific file.

```bash
  pnpm exec playwright test example
```

- Runs the tests in debug mode.

```bash
  pnpm exec playwright test --debug
```

Feel free to customize this setup or extend it to suit your projectâ€™s testing requirements.
